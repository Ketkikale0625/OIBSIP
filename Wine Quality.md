# 🍷 Wine Quality Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview

The focus is on predicting the quality of wine based on its chemical characteristics, offering a real-world application of machine learning in the context of viticulture.
The dataset encompasses diverse chemical attributes, including density and acidity, which serve as the features for three distinct classifier models.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand wine characteristics.
* This project focuses on predicting the quality of red wine based on its chemical properties using three classification models:

  *Random Forest Classifier
  *Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
  *Support Vector Classifier (SVC)

---

## 🗂️ Dataset

**Total Samples** : 1,143
**Features** : 11 (e.g., alcohol, pH, sulphates, density)
**Target Variable** : Wine Quality (categorized as Low, Medium, High)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Python**
* **Pandas, NumPy** → Data handling
* **Matplotlib, Seaborn** → Visualization
* **Scikit-Learn** → Machine Learning models

---

## 📊 Visualizations

The project includes:

* **Countplot** → Distribution of wine quality
* **Correlation Heatmap** → Relationship between features
* **Confusion Matrices** → Model performance
* **Bar Chart** → Accuracy comparison across models

## 🚀 Implementation Steps

1. **Load and explore the dataset**.
2. **Clean and preprocess data** (handling missing values, scaling).
3. **Perform EDA** (distribution plots + correlation heatmap).
4. **Train Models**: Random Forest, SGD, SVC.
5. **Evaluate Models**: Accuracy, classification report, confusion matrix.
6. **Compare results** with a bar graph of model accuracies.

## 📈 Results

* Each model’s **accuracy** and **classification report** are displayed.
* Confusion matrices visualize how well each model predicts wine quality.
* A final bar chart compares the accuracies of all three models.
