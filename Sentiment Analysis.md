# 📝 Sentiment Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a **sentiment analysis model** that can classify text into **positive, negative, or neutral sentiments**. 
This project demonstrates the use of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **machine learning models** for sentiment classification.

## 📂 Dataset

*Features:
-clean_text: Preprocessed text data
--category: Sentiment label (-1 = Negative, 0 = Neutral, 1 = Positive)

The dataset used is already cleaned, tokenized, and ready for vectorization.

## ⚙️ Key Steps

### 1. Data Preprocessing

* Removed **stopwords, punctuation, and special characters**.
* Converted all text to **lowercase**.
* Tokenized sentences and applied **TF-IDF vectorization**.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Counted distribution of sentiments.
* Plotted **bar graph** to visualize sentiment balance.
* Generated a **correlation heatmap** for features.

### 3. Model Building

* Implemented simple **Naive Bayes classifier** for baseline performance.
* Tested other ML models such as Logistic Regression / SVM (optional).

### 4. Model Evaluation

* Evaluated model with **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score**.
* Confusion matrix to check misclassifications.

## 📊 Visualizations

* **Bar Graph** → sentiment distribution.
* **Heatmap** → correlation between features.
* **Confusion Matrix** → classification performance.

---

## 🚀 Results & Insights

* Built a working **sentiment classifier** with good accuracy.
* Positive, Negative, and Neutral sentiments were clearly separated.
* Insights can be applied in:

  * **Customer review analysis** (product feedback).
  * **Social media monitoring** (brand reputation).
  * **Market research** (public sentiment trends).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Python**
* **Pandas, Numpy** → data wrangling
* **Matplotlib, Seaborn** → visualization
* **Scikit-learn** → ML models & evaluation
* **NLTK / Text Processing** → sentiment analysis preprocessing

---

## 📌 Learning Outcomes

* Learned **text preprocessing and cleaning** for NLP.
* Implemented **sentiment classification** using ML.
* Practiced **visualizing text data insights** with bar graphs & heatmaps.
* Understood how to evaluate NLP models using multiple metrics.
